# Mandelbrot in Rust

Learning some Rust by rendering the Mandelbrot set.

## Some commands

1. Run the code: `cargo run «outfile-name»`
2. Build the code: `cargo build`
3. Build the code for release: `cargo build --release`
4. Tidy up the code: `cargo fmt`

## TODO

1. Parallelize
2. Size on command-line
3. Different colouring options
4. Mandelbrot coordinates on command-line
5. Can I make it work in a browser with WASM?
6. Can I make it work in a window?
